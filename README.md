Sinustrom Gentoo Overlay
========================

This Gentoo overlay contains only a few selected packages,
mainly because one of the following reasons:

* Not in official Gentoo portage tree
* Not in the overlays offered by layman or without a maintainer
* Broken in the above repos (and can't wait for it to be fixed)
* Experimental package or for testing purposes

## Adding this overlay to your system

Available in layman. Just run the following command to add it:

    # layman -a sinustrom

If you don't have layman setup yet, please visit the related
[Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Layman) page.
